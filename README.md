# Game Play
## Game Goal
Correctly guess all locations on stage map without using all game lives. Watch out! Each location guess is timed and live is lost not only for wrong guesses but also for round time elapses. Remember to use the hintboard, it helps!
## Game Options
Play single game with multiple rounds on different stages from four loaction scopes: Global, Continental, Sub-Continental and bi-continental. Or go multilevel through 15 different stages from different location scopes.
## Game Ranking
Get special missions to advance your ranking from Junior-Ranger to Senior-Ranger to Captain to Comodore then finally Place-Marshal.
